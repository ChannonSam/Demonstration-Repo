# Demonstration-Repo
My initial repository to explore how Git Hub works

I've not previously used GitHub, but feel it would add substantial clarity and efficiency to my current workflow. It also might stop me from destroying my laptop when I can't remember which version of a script I should be editing and accidentally delete the wrong bit.
